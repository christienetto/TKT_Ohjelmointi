# Cost-Keeping App

## Purpose
This application is a simple cost-keeping tool for couples, designed using Python and Tkinter. It allows partners to track and share costs, making it easier to maintain a fair balance of shared expenses.
Users can log in, add another user as a partner, and track both their own and their partner's expenses within a shared "couple" group.

## Users
- **Partner**: Each user is a partner in a couple. The app allows two users to register and log in, with both partners able to manage shared expenses and view the overall balance.
- **Couple Group**: The app supports a "couple" group, where two users can be registered, and both can contribute to the same set of shared expenses.

## Planned Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register for an account, log in, and add up to one other user as their partner, forming a "couple" group. Both users can manage shared expenses.
- **Expense Input**: Users can input details of their own or their partner's expenses (e.g., date, category, amount).
- **Balance Calculation**: Automatically calculates how much each partner owes or is owed based on shared costs.
- **Expense History**: The app maintains a log of all past expenses and their details, visible to both partners.
- **Clear Function**: Option to clear all entries for a fresh start.

## Extension Ideas
If time allows, these additional features can be added to enhance the app:


- **Groups**: Unfortunately Right now this app only allows monogamous relaionships, but in the future we could implement a groups sharing expenses. 
- **Deploying**: Save expense data and user accounts on a cloud and have this app on phones like on appstore.
- **Notifications**: Set reminders for when a shared expense is due or when a balance needs to be settled.
- **Currency Converter**: Allow users to input expenses in different currencies, with automatic conversion to a common currency.
